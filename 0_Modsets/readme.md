# Modsets Folder
This folder is dedicated for the `Arma 3 Mod Preset.html` files.<br>
Ideally, this folder will contain at least 2 Mod Presets.<br>
- A modset that can be used to edit the mission in the 3den Editor.
  - This includes potential editor only mods.
- A modset that can be used to setup the server and be provided to the players.
  - This excludes editor only mods.
  - This excludes server only mods.

## Default Modsets
At some point, this CVO MISSION Template might come with some possible, pre-defined Mod Presets.<br>
Delete those Mod Presets that are not being used by this project.<br>
