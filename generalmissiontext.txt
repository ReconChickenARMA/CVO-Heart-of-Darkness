Intro Cutscene Text
In 1974, the colonial government of Bocano collapsed with the fall of the Estado Novo.

In the power vacuum that followed, factions of the former resistance fractured, forming two militias, the MPLB and the UPB, to settle their differences.

The eyes of the world fell on Mutambara, and various countries began to provide support, both public and covert, to the combatants.

You are a group bringing arms from the DDR to the UPB, to aid in their fight against the MPLB in the Mutambara region of Bucano.

Your team is made up of military intelligence officers, infantry, and ideological volunteers from foreign countries.

Your mission is to deliver the equipment to a cache established by our allies. Once complete, begin to integrate yourselves into the militia, providing technical and in field support, and providing field reports to High Command.

Good Luck.....
